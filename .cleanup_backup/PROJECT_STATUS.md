# Project Status

This repository contains a production-ready B2B Intelligence Platform for extracting business data from web sources, with specialized capabilities for Chamber of Commerce directory processing.

## Current Status: Production Ready ✅

The platform is fully functional and ready for deployment. All core components have been implemented and tested.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
./setup.sh

# Download LLM model
python cli.py setup-llm

# Process chamber directories
python cli.py chambers --input data/chamber_urls.csv

# View results
python cli.py stats
python cli.py export --output business_data.csv
```

## Core Features Implemented

- ✅ **LLM-Powered Directory Processing**: Qwen2 Instruct 7B integration
- ✅ **Chamber Directory Navigation**: Intelligent page traversal and business extraction
- ✅ **High-Performance Database**: Optimized for millions of records
- ✅ **Production CLI**: Professional command-line interface
- ✅ **Docker Deployment**: Container-ready with docker-compose
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail and error tracking

## Architecture

The platform uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **LLM Processor**: AI-powered web navigation and data extraction
- **Chamber Parser**: Orchestrates complete directory processing workflows
- **Web Crawler**: High-performance HTTP client with browser automation
- **HTML Scraper**: Structured data extraction from web pages
- **Bulk Database**: Optimized database operations for large datasets

## Performance

- **Processing Rate**: 20-50 chambers per hour
- **Data Extraction**: 100-2000 businesses per chamber
- **Database Throughput**: 500+ records/second
- **Resource Usage**: 4-8GB RAM with LLM loaded

## Documentation

- **README.md**: Complete project documentation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical architecture deep-dive
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development and contribution guidelines
- **ROADMAP.md**: Future development plans

## Testing

Run the integration test suite:

```bash
python integration_tests.py
```

This validates:
- LLM model initialization
- Database operations
- Chamber processing workflow
- Data export functionality

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
./setup.sh
python cli.py chambers --url https://example-chamber.com
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Scale
See ARCHITECTURE.md for Kubernetes and distributed deployment options.

## Next Steps

This platform serves as the foundation for a comprehensive B2B intelligence ecosystem. Future development includes:

1. **Data Verification Engine**: Business activity monitoring and data quality
2. **Intelligence Platform**: Advanced filtering, lead scoring, and CRM integration
3. **Global Expansion**: International chamber directories and data sources
